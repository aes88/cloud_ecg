This program uses a web service that performs HR calculations on ECG data along with bradycardia and tachycardia detection. The virtual machine host where our final server is running and servicing requests is vcm-1851.vm.duke.edu. The python file being run is titled "flaskecgmod.py".The various endpoints of the serviceare "/api/heart_rate/summary" for a POST that returns instant HR andbrady/tachy summary, "api/heart_rate/average" for a POST that returns an array of averages over a specific time interval and ""api/requests" to GET the total number of requests the service has served since its most recent reboot.
